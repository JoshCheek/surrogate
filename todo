Shit I just thought of that I want to get out of my head, might be in the stuff below, idk:
-------------

* make compatible with Ruby 2.0's method signatures
* Change substitutability matcher's error messages. Something like
             not subtitutable because:
               Surrogate was missing:
                  RealClass#meth(a)
                  RealClass#meth(b)
               Types did mot match:
                  Surrogate#meth(a) vs RealClass#meth(b)
* Try to make the method comparison agnostic to whether it is talking to a surrogate or a real class
* method missing will inform you that maybe the method was defined by surrogate/rspec, and you need to require that first
* need to add to changelog how all this shit will work
* add the api_method thing, or w/e, talk to Eric and Patrick to see how they want to do it

Urgent (things I want to do immediately, formatted as the git commits I will use)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* be smart enough to handle method missing
* tests around the error messages of types and names
* substitute_for should not depend on rspec-expectations
* Error messages on blocks are actually useful

TODO (next up after urgent, these will happen whenever I get around to it)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* when trying to set a return value, error is NoMethodError will_have_whatever, but would be nice for it to say `UndefinedMethodError bad_stuff is not defined`
* Eventually it should be smart enough to not ignore natively implemented code with a [[:req]] argument
* Remove dependency on all of RSpec and only depend on rspec-core, then have AC tests for the other shit
* Add a better explanation for motivations
* Figure out whether I'm supposed to be using clone or dup for the object -.^ (looks like there may also be an `initialize_copy` method I can take advantage of instead of crazy stupid shit I'm doing now)
* config: rspec_mocks loaded, whether unprepared blocks should raise or just return nil
* extract surrogate/rspec into its own gem
* make substitutability matcher not care whether either are surrogates


Future Features (Things that probably should eventually happen, but not anytime soon unless I get really inspired to work on this shit)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Can endow a class multiple times, results aggregate instead of override
* figure out how to talk about callbacks like #on_success
* have some sort of reinitialization that can hook into setup/teardown steps of test suite (maybe, or maybe I'm happy with what I have)
* Ability to disassociate the method name from the test (e.g. you shouldn't need to change a test just because you change a name)
* ability to declare normal methods as being part of the API
* ability to declare a define that uses the overridden method as the body, but can still act like an api method
* assertions for order of invocations & methods
* class generator? (supports a top-down style of development for when you write your mocks before you write your implementations)
* deal with hard dependency on rspec-mocks
